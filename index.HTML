                <p>Web development is the art and science of creating and maintaining websites. It encompasses two primary areas - Front end development and Back end development.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Front-End Development : the visual elements users interact with, crafted using languages like HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT.</li>
                        <li>Back-End Development : the behind-the-scenes functionality powered by server-side languages like PYTHON, PHP, and Databases.</li>

                <p>Of the Curriculum
                    <ul class="lists">
                        <li>
                            <h4 class="list-subtitle">V1 - 2014</h4>
                            <p>We launched freeCodeCamp with a simple list of 15 resources, including Harvard's CS50 and Stanford's Database Class.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4 class="list-subtitle">V2 - 2015</h4>
                            <p>We added interactive algorithm challenges.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4 class="list-subtitle">V3 - 2015</h4>
                            <p>We added our own HTML+CSS challenges(before we'd been relying on Geneal Assembly's Dash course for these).</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4 class="list-subtitle">V4 - 2016</h4>
                            <p>We expanded the curriculum to 3 certifications, including Front End, Back End, and Data Visualization. They each had 10 required projects, but only  the Front End section had its own challenges. For the other certs, we were still using the external resources like Node School.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4 class="list-subtitle">V5 - 2017</h4>
                            <p>We added the back end and data visualization challenges.</p>
